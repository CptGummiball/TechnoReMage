## Introduction:
Welcome to TechnoReMage, an exciting project to revive the classic game Technomage from the year 2000. Our goal is to breathe new life into this great game and make it accessible to a modern player base. We aim to preserve the magic of the original game while making improvements to provide an even more impressive gaming experience.

## Our Goal:
Our goal is to revive the magnificent game Technomage from the year 2000 and give it a fresh new look. In addition to updating the graphics and using a new engine, we also want to fix all the issues that were not addressed by the original developer.

## What We Offer:
- **Updated graphics and new engine:** We will update the game's graphics and use a modern game engine to achieve improved visual representation.
- **Bug fixes:** We will fix known bugs and issues from the original game to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
- **Gameplay preservation:** The basic gameplay of Technomage will remain unchanged, but we will implement Quality-of-Life features to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Optional perspective switch:** We will provide players with the option to switch between different perspectives to tailor the gaming experience to their preferences.
- **New video sequences:** We will introduce new video sequences to enrich the game's story and provide deeper immersion.
- **Enhanced soundtracks:** We will improve audio quality and add new soundtracks to create a captivating acoustic atmosphere.
- **High Definition textures and models:** We will use high-resolution textures and models to achieve stunning visual quality and bring the game to life.
